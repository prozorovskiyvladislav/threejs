# threejs
This is project where I tried to learn something new about three js and node js.
So somethins what I've learned in this project:

It's a monorepo with client and server.

Client part it's a vite generated react-typescript template with pretty simple structure.

To local run you should clone this repo and type in terminal:
cd client
npm run dev
and that's it.

Server part it's a simple express server with one useful routes which working with openai and generate some image.
